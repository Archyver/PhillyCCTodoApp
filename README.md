# PhillyCCTodo

## Introduction

This project was used at the Philly Code Camp "Angular 101" class. It was originally written for Angular 6, but has been updated to be used with Angular 7.

The class involved building a simple

It demonstrates a number of Angular features, including:

- Components
- Modules
- Routing
- Databinding
- Events
- Reactive Forms
- HTTP Services
- Use of Observables
- Directives
- Validation
- Custom Validation
- Use of Bootstrap
- Use of Angular Material

## Process

The code is divided into 20 branches, ranging from Step1 to Step20.

Each branch has a "lesson", that is, a demonstration of some new feature. Thus, the todo application is slowly built and improved with each branch.

The document ToDoChanges.md describes each step and what new code has been added. There also comments in the code where new items were added, and thus on each step, you can search this pattern -- "Step X" -- to find new code for each level.
